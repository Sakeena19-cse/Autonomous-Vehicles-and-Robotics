# Autonomous-Vehicles-and-Robotics
üöó Autonomous Vehicles & ü§ñ Robotics
This project explores the intersection of Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics, focusing on the technologies and algorithms that enable machines to perceive, decide, and act in dynamic environments.

üîç Overview
Autonomous vehicles and robotics rely on a combination of:

Perception Systems (e.g., sensors like LiDAR, cameras, GPS)

Localization & Mapping (SLAM, sensor fusion)

Path Planning & Control (A*, RRT, PID, MPC)

Machine Learning & Computer Vision (Object detection, tracking, semantic segmentation)

Decision Making & Autonomy (Finite state machines, behavior trees, reinforcement learning)

üìå Goals
Simulate or deploy autonomous navigation in real or virtual environments

Implement key robotics algorithms for mobility and control

Integrate AI techniques to enhance perception and decision-making

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies
ROS (Robot Operating System)

Python / C++

Gazebo / RViz / Unity / Webots (for simulation)

OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch (for vision & ML)
